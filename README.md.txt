# File Encryption and Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python project that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric key cryptography with the `cryptography` library.

## Project Structure


## Features
- Generate and store encryption keys
- Encrypt text files securely
- Decrypt files back to original form

## How to Use
1. Run the notebook: `FileEncryptionDecryptionTool.ipynb`
2. Make sure `simple.txt` exists in the same folder.
3. Update the file name or password as needed in the code.
4. Run encryption and decryption cells step by step.

## Requirements

Install dependencies using:


---

### Step 2: Create `requirements.txt`

1. Open another new Notepad file.
2. Paste this code:


3. Save it as: `requirements.txt` inside your `FileEncryptionDecryptionTool` folder.
